It’s becoming increasingly clear that we will need an AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM). Just as with a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), there are potentially important questions when we use an AI model, which we’re not set up to answer meaningfully. 
As organizations increasingly rely on AI to make decisions and automate processes, it becomes essential to understand how these models are built, including the datasets used, the data lineage, and the methodologies applied. This initiative on AIBOM (MLBOM) aims to provide this visibility, ensuring that AI systems are auditable and traceable, which helps mitigate risks such as bias, data integrity issues, and unintended consequences. Furthermore, as regulatory scrutiny of AI increases, AIBOM is a foundational tool to demonstrate compliance and foster stakeholder trust.
The initiative will ensure ​​alignment and collaboration with OWASP CycloneDX, OWASP AI Exchange, etc. Collaboration with CycloneDX will be essential to defining the format and attributes of the AIBOM structure, and collaboration with AIExchange will be necessary for an organization to adopt the AIBOM.
