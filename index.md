# OWASP AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM) Project

> **Making AI Systems Transparent, Auditable, and Secure**

---

## Project Announcement

We're excited to announce the **formal launch of the OWASP AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM) Project!** 

Just as Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) and Hardware Bill of Materials (HBOMs) brought clarity to software and hardware supply chains, **AIBOM aims to provide transparency into how AI models are built, trained, and deployed**.

Building on OWASP's long-standing tradition of making security visible, we're now extending this mission to AI systems to address the critical need for AI model transparency across the ecosystem.

---

## Project Mission

The OWASP AIBOM Project establishes a comprehensive framework that:

### **Identifies and Documents**
- **Model lineage** and provenance
- **Training datasets** and data sources
- **Model risks** and vulnerabilities  
- **Dependencies** and third-party components

### **Supports Secure AI Adoption**
- Enables secure deployment across industries and geographies
- Provides risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Facilitates compliance with emerging AI regulations

### **Bridges Communities**
- Connects practitioners, researchers, regulators, and vendors
- Promotes open collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Establishes industry-wide standards and best practices

---

## Why AIBOM Matters

As organizations increasingly rely on AI to make critical decisions and automate processes, it becomes essential to understand:

- **How models are built** - datasets, methodologies, and training processes
- **Data lineage and quality** - ensuring integrity and reducing bias
- **Risk factors** - identifying potential vulnerabilities and limitations
- **Compliance requirements** - meeting regulatory and governance standards

AIBOM provides this visibility, ensuring AI systems are **auditable**, **traceable**, and **trustworthy**, helping organizations mitigate risks such as bias, data integrity issues, and unintended consequences.

---

## Strategic Collaborations

This initiative ensures alignment and collaboration with key OWASP projects and industry standards:

- **OWASP CycloneDX** - Defining AIBOM format and attributes
- **OWASP AI Exchange** - Supporting organizational AIBOM adoption
- **Industry Standards Bodies** - Ensuring regulatory compliance
- **Research Communities** - Advancing AI transparency methodologies
